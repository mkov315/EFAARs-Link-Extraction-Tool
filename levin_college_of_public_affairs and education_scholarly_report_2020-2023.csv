825,"Wang, Lih-Ching C",Creative Production,"CSU’s arrangements with East China Normal University (ECNU) to provide two specific courses in the Urban Education Ph.D. Program with a Specialization in “Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL)” require that both institutions sign off on both a memorandum of understanding and a formal agreement. This has been a challenge, partially due to repeated changes in administrations at both institutions. The two courses currently exist as EDB 813 (Cognitive Studies in Chinese as a Foreign Language, 3 credits) and EDB 814 (Theories of Teaching Chinese as a Second/Foreign Language, 3 credits). However, two doctoral students in the TCFL program (Xuan Song and Xiaona Jin) were required to take those two courses online in Fall 2020. To resolve this issue, it was necessary for me to be very creative. First, in Summer 2020, I discussed with Dr. YiChung Chou [the Dean of the College of Arts in National Changhua University of Education (NCUE) in Changhua Taiwan] the possibility of offering both courses in Fall 2020 for CSU. Unfortunately, NCUE had no resources to teach those two courses for CSU immediately in Fall 2020. I also discussed with the College of Chinese Language & Culture of Beijing Normal University (BNU) the possibility of offering those two courses for CSU in Fall 2020. BNU did not currently offer exact equivalents of those two courses, but BNU was able to offer the following two courses for CSU’s doctoral students to take online in Fall 2020: (1) “Chinese Grammatology and Lexicology” (3 credits, used to substitute for EDB 813, and (2) “Research Methodology of Chinese Philology” (3 credits, used to substitute for EDB 814). Authorization for these course substitutions was obtained from Dr. Julia Phillips (the Director of Doctoral Studies) and Dr. Brian Yusko (the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs) in the College of Education and Human Services at CSU.",,Fall 2020
826,"Wang, Lih-Ching C",Creative Production,"In Spring 2021, I have begun to integrate the use of Google Drive as a storage location for teaching materials used in ETE 501 (Technology Strand) and ETE 572 (Advancements in Educational Technology). The process provides highly secure storage which allows for easy editing of course materials and efficient linking into course shells in Blackboard. I plan to continue this practice and gradually expand it to encompass my other courses. ",,Spring 2021
827,"Wang, Lih-Ching C",Creative Production,"I have continued to coordinate the Urban Education Ph.D. Program with a Specialization in “Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL)” in the College of Education and Human Services at CSU. As of April 30, 2021, two doctoral students are studying in this specialization program. Three doctoral students were admitted to the program to begin studies in Fall 2020, but have been unable to begin their studies due to pandemic-related visa issues. Two additional doctoral students have now been admitted to the program to begin studies in Fall 2021. ",,Spring 2021

830,"Wang, Lih-Ching C",Creative Production,"Both ETE 812 (Educational Technology in Chinese Language Instruction, 4 credits) and EDC 811 (Training, Development, and Supervision of Teachers of Foreign Language, 4 credits) were previously to be offered at CSU for doctoral students in the Urban Education Ph.D. Program with a Specialization in “Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL)”. Due to low enrollment, we were unable to offer these two courses in Spring 2021. In Fall 2020, I worked intensively to resolve this issue by discussing with Dr. Julia Phillips (the Director of Doctoral Studies), Dr. Brian Yusko (the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs), Dr. Deborah Morin (the Director of Center for Educational Leadership), and Dr. Frederick Hampton (Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling, Administration, Supervision & Adult Learning) in the College of Education and Human Services at CSU how to allow Xuan Song and Xiaona Jin (doctoral students in the TCFL specialization) to substitute other CSU graduate course for these two requirements while also allowing them to enroll for at least the 8 minimum credit hours required of them in Spring 2021. Fortunately, we resolved the issue by allowing them to take the following courses in Spring 2021: (1) ETE 572 (Advancements in Educational Technology, 3 credits) plus EDU 897 (Individual Project, 1 credit, addressing a shortfall of one graduate credit), and (2) ADM 676 (Clinical Supervision/Professional Development, 3 credits) plus EDU 897 (Individual Project, 1 credit, addressing a shortfall of one graduate credit). All were taken in lieu of ETE 812 and EDC 811.",,Spring 2021
831,"Wang, Lih-Ching C",Creative Production,"The majority of student candidates for the “Master of Education in Curriculum & Instruction: PreK-12 Education in Chinese Language (Initial Licensure)” were generally recruited from China and Taiwan. Due to the coronavirus pandemic during 2020 and 2021, many prospective students have been reluctant to travel abroad to study at CSU. In addition, F1 visas from China have been limited due to US-China policy changes. These factors have dramatically impacted the enrollment for this program, and have made it impossible to offer some courses and sections of courses as originally scheduled. While I have continued efforts to recruit more students for the program in Spring 2021, at the request of the Department of Curriculum & Foundations and the CEHS Dean’s Office I have remapped the course sequence for the small number of students in the future in the program. They will take EDB 502 (Psychological Foundations of Education, 3 credits) with the Master of Urban Secondary Teaching (MUST) program students in Summer. EDB 502 is a regular part of their program of study, but is normally taken in Fall semester in a separate section for Chinese language licensure students. This remapping will move the course to Summer semester and combine them with MUST students. Then, in lieu of their EDB 595 (Seminar on Integrating Theory and Practice, 3 credits) requirement, they would take EGT 582 (Action Research in Gifted Education, 2 credits), plus one credit of Independent Study, in Spring semester.",,Spring 2021
